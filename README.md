Sprint Review and Retrospective
(1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

-User Stories is commonly used by development teams in the agile development model to identify certain user requirements. User Stories should be brief to avoid complexity on what the client actually requires to be implemented. You can have many User Stories that aimt at a specific feature the developer will program. Priortizing the stories between Small, Medium, and Large will also help developers determine which features may require more work.

(2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

-You should be flexible, agile allows you to test as many times as needed throughout a process before you submit a final result. If you are working with one code that worked and now have to combine it with more code, repeative testing is expected. Collaboration should be used as much as possible to avoid delays 

(3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

-To be a good team member, one should also refer to the golden rule "Treat everyone as you wish to be treated". Not everyone in software will have the same background experience in software and software is always changing. Staying humble and accountable will make the team easier to be around and work with.
